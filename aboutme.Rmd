## I SCUBA 
### Because Fishes Are Easier to Talk to Than People

For the last 8 years, I've spent much of my time SCUBA diving for various labs at UCSB. The first of those labs being the Love Lab (https://lovelab.msi.ucsb.edu/). The majority of our diving involved counting fish underneath and around oil platforms throughout California. 

Much like the Mafia, the only way out of the Love Lab is in a pine box, so even as I've moved on the other groups, I'm always on-cal for another misadventure with the gang.
