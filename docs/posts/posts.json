As a bright eyed and bushy tailed undergraduate, in the incoming class of 2011, I spent a lot of time surfing with my friends, stuffing my face at the dining commons, and studying for classes… sometimes.\r\nI managed to join the Love Lab in 2014, got my AAUS (American Academy of Underwater Sciences) certification, and began doing reasearch on the fishes living around Santa Barbara’s Oil platforms. I found myself spending a lot of time diving around the oil platforms in our area, a little less time surfing, and even a little less studying.\r\nIn the years following my graduation (2015), I spent MOST of my time SCUBA diving oil platforms, some of my time working as a deckhand aboard a commercial passenger fishing vessel (got to pay the bills somehow), very little of my time surfing, and (thankfully) no time studying for classes.\r\nThen one fateful day I decided to go back to school for a graduate degree.\r\nNow I spend MOST of my time studying for classes and analyzing data for my thesis, a few days a month I SCUBA for miscellanious work projects, and my surfboard gathers dust in the corner of the room I’m writing this blog post from.\r\nSuch is my time at UCSB, past and present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
