The first of those labs being the Love Lab (https://lovelab.msi.ucsb.edu/). The majority of our diving involved counting fish underneath and around oil platforms throughout California.\r\nMuch like the Mafia, the only way out of the Love Lab is in a pine box, so even as I’ve moved on the other groups, I’m always on-cal for another misadventure with the gang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
